# Laissez Tender

Today, many x402 services look interchangeable. Buyers must sift through them and guess who delivers real value. 

Laissez Tender flips that dynamic: buyers publish a tender, and sellers compete to meet the brief. For buyers, instead of chasing sellers, buyers set the terms, then the market responds. For sellers, they can promote themselves more effectively for the specific use case at hand, rather than optimising for general observability.

Discoverability is a solution for an inherently human problem because of our bounded rationality. The same is not true for LLMs and agents, opening the opportunity for a new scalable paradigm for how resources are bought and sold.
